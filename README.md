# CS4170 - Data Mining with Applications in the Life Sciences

In this class, we built a code base which is able to classify individuals as having cancer or being cancer-free by examining their genomic data. Each week we would learn a new concept and make additions to our previous code to prove understanding of the new material. We explored a variety of methods which yield varying degrees of accuracy, including decision trees, the Phi Function, Information Gain, random forests, and k-fold cross validation.

Activity 12 has the full codebase which was built over the whole semester, and thus has every other week's activity within it.
