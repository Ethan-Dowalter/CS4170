Dr. Welch,

 

Figure 1 here shows the updated Feature Table after adding an additional column for "TP - FP" and sorting by that column in descending order. As I believe I said at the end of last week's report, the feature which maximizes the value for "TP - FP" is DOCK3, and its value is 12. 



Figure 1: The top 10 features in the Feature Table when sorted by "TP - FP".

 

 

After selecting DOCK3 to be our classifier, I separated the samples into two lists as shown in Figure 2 here.



Figure 2: Shows the lists of samples for those that have the DOCK3 mutation and those that do not.

 

 

Then finally I made the confusion matrix, as shown in Figure 3, to represent the classification of all samples based on the DOCK3 mutation.

The DOCK3 mutation is the most useful feature to classify by, but it still incorrectly classifies 44/162 (27.16%) of the samples. This means that it is an inadequate test by itself when testing for cancer. Because of this, we are going to have to use several other mutations in a decision tree to increase our accuracy for diagnoses. I am very optimistic about how accurate we can get the predictions after developing a decision tree that is several layers high, which makes me excited about the work for the coming weeks!

 

Also, I've attached my source code, data, and screenshots as always.

 

Thank you,

Ethan Dowalter
